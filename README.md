Automatic Information System (AIS) data are a powerful tool for tracking and monitoring fishing vessels. However, AIS devices can be intentionally disabled, reducing the efficacy of AIS as a monitoring tool. The purpose of this reposity is to archive the scripts used in Welch et al. 20xx to 1. identify intentional disabling events, 2. estimate activity obscured by intentional disabling events, and 3. fit and validate boosted regression tree models to identify the drivers of intentional AIS disabligne vents.
