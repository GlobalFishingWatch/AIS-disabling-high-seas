**figs_model_selection.py**: Generates all model selection figures. See `model_selection/README.md` for how to get the data for the final model for the paper so this will run correctly. To run: `python -m figs_model_selection --lowest_rec 10 --run_double True`

**figs_time_lost_to_gaps_results.py**: Generates Figs 1&2 and Fig S18 (as labeled in initial Science Advances submission). To run: `python -m figs_time_lost_to_gaps_results`

**figs_time_lost_to_gaps_methods.py**: Generates Figs S15-17 (as labeled in initial Science Advances submission). To run: `python -m figs_time_lost_to_gaps_methods`
